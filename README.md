## Instructions

* It is recommended not to run the data_cleaning_notebook files as execution typically takes 15 minutes for the denver area and 2+ hours for London.
* Prior to executing the data analysis notebooks, run RUN_THIS_FIRST.py, it will extract necessary files and update the .gitignore file appropriately

Class Project #1: Exploring the Relationship Between Airbnb & Starbucks

Introduction:  Project 1 for AI Bootcamp.  
This is the first project for the first class of AI Bootcamp (running October 2023 – April 2024). We were assigned team members by instructor and were given a list of potential datasets that might be interesting to explore. We choose Airbnb and Starbucks.  The following class periods (and time out of class) was spent downloading the data, cleaning the data and exploring the data.  Finally, we agreed upon our findings and determined how we would present our results.
